Copyright 2025 Jiamu Sun <barroit@linux.com>
You can copy this license text around as-is, but don't edit it.

This [filename] isn't code. It's artwork. It's not covered by GPL, MIT, or any
other open source license. It lives under Miku's Despotic Mandate License v2
only.

You can copy and redistribute this artwork anywhere, in any medium you want, as
long as you follow the rules below. You can't modify the artwork, except for
changing format (PNG to SVG, JPEG to WebP, whatever) or scaling it bigger or
smaller, and even then it doesn't make it yours. The work is still mine, and it
stays under this license.

Rules (follow them or get your ass kicked)
==========================================

1.	Include this license in your repo, workspace, or whatever project you
	dump the artwork into. SPDX-License-Identifier: LicenseRef-MDM-2.0 is
	fine as a pointer, but the full text must be present somewhere. Just
	don't pretend it's unlicensed.

2.	Credit me, Jiamu Sun, loud and clear. If it's in a code repo, slap my
	name in the top-level readme file. If it's somewhere else, put it in
	equally user-facing docs. Don't do half-ass "hidden in a corner" shit.

3.	If you show this artwork on a website or any public showcase, you must
	attach my name to the thing in a machine-readable way. Example:

	  <div itemscope itemtype='https://schema.org/ImageObject'>
	    <img src='miku.png' alt='Miku illustration' itemprop='contentUrl'>
	    <meta itemprop='copyrightHolder' content='Jiamu Sun'>
	  </div>

	Don't skip this. Don't hide credit in fine print.

4.	This is non-commercial only. You don't get to slap it on a T-shirt,
	shove it in a product, or otherwise make money off it, directly or
	indirectly.

You may use this version of the license, or any later version published by
Jiamu Sun. The canonical copy of this license lives at:
